# OpenQDA Core Architecture
 TBD
 
## Client

We use Vue 3 as our frontend engine, vite as bundler and many Laravel-specific tools for communication
(Echo, Intertia etc.)

### Component System
Our long-term goal is to maintain a flexible component system that "speaks" the OpenQDA design system.
For this we use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to develop and update the components.
