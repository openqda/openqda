# OpenQDA Deployment

This guide describes how to deploy OpenQDA to your custom infrastructure.
Currently, there are two options for deployment:


## Via Docker

> Please note, that deployment via Docker is different from the Docker setup,
described in the [docker installation guide for local development!](../installation/docker.md)!

We will provide a comprehensive guide very soon. 
Until then, we would like to point you to the following resources:

- https://docs.docker.com/guides/frameworks/laravel/
- https://github.com/laradock/laradock

## Manual

Manual installation has great overlap with [manual installation](http://localhost:5173/openqda/installation/manual.html).
We will soon provide this guid to cover topics, specific to the production installation (webserver, certificates etc.).
