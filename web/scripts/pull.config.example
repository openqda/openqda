# OpenQDA Backup Pull Configuration
#
# This file contains configuration for the pull script.
# Copy this file to pull.config and adjust the values as needed.
#
# The pull script is run ON THE BACKUP SERVER to pull backups FROM the
# application server. This provides better security than pushing backups,
# as the application server does not need credentials to access the backup server.
#
# All settings can also be provided as environment variables or command-line arguments.

# Local backup directory (on the backup server)
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/openqda"

# Application server configuration (where backups are created)
# This is the server running OpenQDA with backups created by backup.sh
APP_SERVER_HOST="app.example.com"
APP_SERVER_USER="backup-reader"
APP_SERVER_BACKUP_PATH="/var/backups/openqda"
APP_SERVER_PORT="22"

# Optional: SSH key path (if not using default)
# APP_SERVER_KEY="/path/to/ssh/key"

# Log file location
LOG_FILE="/var/backups/openqda/pull.log"
