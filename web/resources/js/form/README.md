# OpenQDA Form System

Our goal is to provide an auto-generation system, where forms
are entirely generated by schema.

For now, we use a custom system (as opposed to libraries like formkit)
due to several reasons:

- we want to keep the footprint as low as possible
- we want to have 100% control over style and functionality
- we want to ensure that openqda-specific needs are 100% supported
- we don't use any of the other features

For a detailed documentation on the supported schema properties, please look into the API docs.
